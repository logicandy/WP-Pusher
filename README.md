WP Pusher
=========

WP Pusher is a simple plugin that (currently) notifies visitors of your WordPress site when a new post is created in real-time using [Pusher](http://pusher.com) and the `publish_post` hook. It creates a small popup on the bottom left of the web page with a message and a link to the new post which appears for 10 seconds, until it finally fades out.

Don't forget to download the [pusher-php-server](https://github.com/pusher/pusher-php-server) submodule as well. It will not authenticate users without it.
